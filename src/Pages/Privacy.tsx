                                <p>When individual users upload their Emirates ID, we extract essential data including the ID
                                    number, full name, and expiry date using OCR tools. This data is then cross-referenced with the
                                    information provided during registration. The original ID file and extracted data are stored
                                    securely on our servers using AES-256 encryption. Access is restricted through RBAC (RoleBased Access Control) and data is automatically deleted after a retention period of 90 days
                                    unless required for legal purposes.</p>
